# MyShallowNetwork
Creating Shallow network by myself coded. Inspiration from Andrew NG's Deep learning Course

This is a python notebook written in python3. 
Uses sklearn ( only for preprocessing and dataset) and numpy.
Used breast_cancer dataset from sklearn
Coded SGD for 2 layered neural network. With 4 hidden units in hidden layer.

Heavy inspiration from Andrew NG
NOTE: There are few debug comments left, feel free to cut them out. I prefer keeping them in case it breaks down in future.

Just run the code and enjoy !!!
