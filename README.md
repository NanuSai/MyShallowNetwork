# MyShallowNetwork
Creating Shallow network by myself coded. Inspiration from Andrew NG's Deep learning Course


Coded SGD for 2 layered neural network. With 4 hidden units in hidden layer.

Heavy inspiration from Andrew NG
NOTE: 1.There are few debug comments left, feel free to cut them out. I prefer keeping them in case it breaks down in future.
2.The first file is computes negative cost and is bugged (because I used multi class dataset on a single class system).
3.I'm new to github so I really don't much of its functionality, please forgive any professional errors
4.MyShallowNetwork_working is the correct one, feel free to plug in various binary class datasets and check it out.

Just run the code and enjoy !!!
